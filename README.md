- Got the dataset from here: https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=super

### About the Case Study
- Maven motors is a new cars company looking to widen its horizons in USA in 2022.
- The company has bought a spot in Super Bowl Commercials - An advertising Company
- As an analyst, I have to recommend a data driven strategy for the company by analysing the historical data of super bowl commercials.

### Results:
- Based on the data avaiable to me, I researched and decided to work on some of the factors responsible for making the ad go viral.
- Factors I considered: Type of content, What other car brands have shown in ads, Cost for the ad, Length of ad, Views the ad gets.
- By analysing the data I found that the ad which has funny content get more views and buying a 60 second spot gives the company 185 percent more views than a 30 second spot.
- Also discovered that other car companies have shown funny content more, and showed the product more quickly only 50 percent of the time.
- Estimated that the average cost per second for an ad will be 1.971 lakh dollars.
